pyNDUS is an open-source python package to perform Sensitivity and Uncertainty analyses. The code mainly exploits the relative covariance matrices stored in the ENDF-6 formatted files (processed by [NJOY](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016) and parsed by [SANDY](https://github.com/luca-fiorito-11/sandy)) and sensitivity coefficients computed with other codes (e.g., industrial codes like [ERANOS](https://www.oecd-nea.org/tools/abstract/detail/nea-1683/) or [Serpent 2](https://serpent.vtt.fi/)).
